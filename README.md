This is a fork of the Oufti software package, to allow correction of lineage assignment errors and other improvements to the user interface.

To run:

1. Ensure this folder is in your MATLAB path (right click and select "Add to Path > Selected Folders and Subfolders")
2. run the script `oufti` by entering:

        oufti

    in the MATLAB command window, or opening the script `source/gui/oufti.m` and clicking "Run"

Only the Mac version of oufti is supported in this fork at this time.
